## Overview

The problem: Many college students have limited kitchen resources, limited cooking skills, limited time, limited access to grocery stores, and no access to creative recipes that respect these constraints. As a result, college students spend money to eat out, or eat non-healthy foods at fast food places or through vending machines.

The solution: Air Fry Till I Die creates a way for students (on-campus or off) to learn and share recipes that:

Can be made using minimal kitchen facilities (at a minimum, a air fryer).
Can be made out of ingredients that are available within walking distance of UH.
Suit local taste sensibilities.
Can be filtered via dietary restrictions (gluten-free, vegan, etc).
Have an estimated cost per serving.
Has an estimated number of servings per recipe.
Has an estimate of how long it takes to make.
