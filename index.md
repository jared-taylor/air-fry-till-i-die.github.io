## Overview

As college students move out on their own, it may be challenging for some to find ways to cook fast and convenient meals, which saves money over ordering expensive restaurant food and unhealthy fast food. Fortunately, there is a kitchen appliance quickly gaining popularity which can be a game-changer for the novice chef: the air fryer

##Why air fry?

An air fryer offers an extremely easy way to make food quickly while reducing mess and calories. It is a great way to make easy student-freindly staples like fries, chicken nuggets, or other crispy favorites while also reducing risk of fires by forgetful students preoccupied with studying and homework. It offers the speed and convenience of being able to drop in some food, turn on a timer, and being able to safely walk away that a microwave offers, while not sacrificing texture and flavor, and at a similar price point.

In addition to being able to make crispy frozen food items, air fryers can be used to easily prepare a number of simple recipes made from quality ingredients that would normally require a full oven or stove top and only take up a small amount of space in a dorm room or small apartment kitchen, making them ideal for students. Curated on this site are some simple recipes that a novice cook can prepare in a few minutes from a small handful of ingredients at a reasonable price, along with resources for where to find these ingredients.
